			2024-2025 Into the Deep Robot (FTC)
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Drivetrain
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our robot is versatile, protected, and agile. Versatile: GoBILDA U-Channel allows for a multitude of
			mounting options, and we modified our pieces of channel to contain only the parts we needed, saving weight.
			Protected: 3D-printed bumpers, Control Hub mounts, and a ramp prevent any sample from getting stuck under or
			inside our robot. By covering up the space needed for other subsystems, we can afford the ability to drive
			and operate carefree. Agile: Using the GoBILDA mecanum wheels, we were able to create an agile and efficient
			way of moving around the field.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Intake
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our specialized point-tipped claw efficiently picks out samples in dense clusters, allowing us to take our
			alliance-specific sample from the submersible and increase our teleop score. An integrated camera provides
			detection and location of the sample in the submersible, allowing intaking to be automated and reducing
			human error. Using our odometry and some trigonometry, the field-centric claw stays at the same angle and
			position no matter where the robot is on the field or what direction it is facing, enabling the driver to
			input controls from their perspective instead of the robot’s and making intaking much less complicated.
			Finally, instead of belted or strung extensions, we used a linkage for quick and reliable intaking, run by a
			single 117 RPM GoBilda motor, providing high speed, torque, and precision.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Deposit
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our robot’s extension, arm, and claw were designed for speed, strength, and reliability. Using two
			belt-driven GoBILDA Viper Slides powered by 435 RPM motors, we created a quick and strong extension system
			for depositing samples and specimens. For our deposit arm, we implemented a Coaxial Virtual 4 Bar (CV4B)
			mechanism, as it is reliable, agile, and keeps the majority of the load off the end of the arm. This arm is
			powered by three main servos, two for driving and turning the bars, and one for coaxial tilt. The two drive
			servos rotate the main arm around the coaxial shaft, allowing it to move independently from the shaft
			itself, while the coaxial servo controls the shaft, which is belted to the end effector to manage tilt. Our
			claw was 3D printed from ABS filament to be rigid and strong, and is thicker than our intake claw to
			effectively grab and score specimens without accidentally releasing them.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Ascent
		</h2>
		<p>
			To keep our design simple and space-efficient, we integrated our hooks directly into the CV4B mounts. This
			approach not only saves space but also distributes the load evenly across a larger area, improving
			durability during climbs. However, the angles of our deposit slides caused the back of the robot to scrape
			against the bottom rung of the submersible during ascent, preventing a successful pull-up. To address this,
			we added horizontal rollers to the back of the robot, allowing them to roll smoothly against the rung and
			enable a clean, consistent climb.
		</p>

		<h1 id="Firetruck2025">
			2025 Fire Fighting Competition
		</h1>
		<p>
			This year, we were lucky to be invited to participate in a cross-district robotics challenge. The objective
			of the competition is to put out 8 candles in the span of 1 minute and 30 seconds. There are also 3 squishy
			balls scattered around the field, and each ball that you pick up take 30 seconds off your time. Many
			obstacles, such as ramps, debris and tunnels were on the field, and the drivers had to maneuver around them.
			We were the winning team, and our sister team came second.
		</p>

		<h1 id="Awards">
			Awards
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Think Award - 1<sup>st</sup> place
		</h2>
		<p>
			The think award is given to the team with the best engineering portfolio at an event, recognizing clear
			documentation of the design process and technical achievements. It is the second most prestigious award in
			FTC, right below the Inspire award. We earned this award at our second qualifier, which secured our
			advancement to the BC Provincial Championship.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Control Award - 2<sup>nd</sup> place
		</h2>
		<p>
			The control award is given to teams that have superior software and utilize sensors, control systems and
			programming to boost their robots’ capabilities on the field. There were many aspects of our robot that
			allowed us to receive this award. Firstly, to reduce the work of the driver, we use vision to automatically
			align the claw while intaking a sample. To do any useful vision processing, an OpenCV pipeline is necessary,
			so we created a custom OpenCV pipeline which could detect multiple colours. We also had multiple autonomous
			modes for each side of the field. Our specimen auto could score us 119 points, while the sample auto could
			score us 83 points. For consistent, repeatable paths, we used the Pedro Pathing library. Finally, we
			designed a “position lock” mode that lets the driver lock the robot’s current pose; the robot actively
			applies power to counter external forces, providing more than enough holding torque for typical match
			interactions.
